## Low switching cost between domains

Research, systems architecture, and commercialization share the same underlying structure: hypothesis, design, implementation, validation. Moving between them does not require a role change. It requires the same discipline applied to different outputs. The global strategist position formalizes this. One identity. Multiple execution modes.

## Research, systems, commercialization

- **Research** produces signal, framework, and narrative. Output: papers, memoranda, client-facing communication.
- **Systems** produce leverage. Output: platforms, workflows, reproducibility.
- **Commercialization** produces distribution and growth. Output: client dialogue, consultant engagement, asset flow.

These are not sequential stages. They are parallel channels. Capability in one increases the return on the others. Integration is the multiplier.

## Technological inflection points reward integrators

When tools change—LLMs, agentic workflows, data infrastructure—the advantage goes to those who can absorb the change and redeploy existing domain knowledge through new systems. Specialists optimize within a stack. Integrators reassemble the stack. The global strategist role is structured for reassembly: research depth defines what to build; systems define how it scales; commercialization defines who it reaches.

## Why this role enables cross-platform leverage

The title reflects function. Global strategist implies scope across products, clients, and platforms. Quantitative research and portfolio management supply the domain. Systems architecture supplies the lever. The combination yields cross-vertical leverage: the same person can move from research narrative to system design to client presentation without handoffs. That reduces latency and preserves consistency. Institutional asset management benefits when the same mind traces the path from idea to implementation to client.

## Operating sequence

Research → Architecture → Commercialization → Institutional Leverage. That is the operating system. This page is the meta-identity: the integrator model, stated explicitly.
