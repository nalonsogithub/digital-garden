## Structural Problem

Low-volatility portfolios historically exhibit higher Sharpe ratios but lower absolute returns relative to market-cap benchmarks. The industry tradeoff between efficiency and return creates allocation challenges for institutional investors.

## Research Objective

Design a long-only, non-levered equity framework that preserves the efficiency characteristics of low-volatility investing while targeting market-level risk and return participation.

## Architecture

- Risk-allocation based portfolio construction.
- Multidimensional risk balancing across equity universe.
- Structural objective of low correlation to traditional long-only portfolios.

## Research extension

- Supported by 20+ internal research pieces exploring regime behavior, sector sensitivity, macro alignment, and performance dispersion.

## Commercial outcome

- Successfully commercialized as institutional strategy.
- Raised $700M+ independently.
- Integrated into broader platform architecture.
