## Context

Within a ~$400M U.S. small-cap long-short strategy at Mellon Capital, developed quantitative factors and portfolio construction enhancements. Designed a portfolio optimization constraint to maximize differentiation from common institutional factor exposures using fund holdings data, factor crowding metrics, and market microstructure intelligence.

## Impact

This architecture materially reduced unintended beta exposure during systemic stress. In 2008, while most long-only and long-short portfolios experienced significant drawdowns, the strategy delivered approximately flat performance and ranked at the top of its peer group.
