## Purpose

Outward-facing interface that exposes the internal mechanics of quantitative models and portfolio optimization results.

## Architecture

The system provides a navigable representation of the investment process: from raw signals through model scores, optimization, and final portfolio positions. It is designed for use by portfolio managers and sales teams in client conversations.

## Capabilities

- **Multi-level alpha drill-down** to the most atomic signal component.
- **Cross-stock comparison** across model dimensions.
- **Traceability** from signal → model score → optimization result → final portfolio position.
- **Explanation of position sizing** based on optimization constraints and interactions.

## Strategic value

- Converts black-box quantitative process into a transparent, navigable structure.
- Enables portfolio managers and sales teams to articulate model logic with precision.
- Bridges research, portfolio management, and client-facing communication.

## Measurable outcomes

- Contributed to firm asset gathering in a multi-factor environment.
- Supported increased meeting coverage and hit rates.
- Transitioned from experimental demo to firm-supported infrastructure.

*Attribution is organizational; the system contributed to improved operational leverage and positioning.*

## Adoption

- Cross-functional adoption across Sales, Portfolio Management, Research, and IT Infrastructure.
- Rapid expansion from demo usage to broader operational relevance.
- Transition from experimental tool to firm-supported infrastructure.
