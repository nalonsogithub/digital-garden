## Purpose

Designed and developed as a modular AI-enabled sales intelligence system to support market analysis, portfolio commentary, and competitive positioning.

## Architecture

The platform comprises three integrated components: a market analysis engine (structured data backbone), an AI commentary generator (agentic LLM workflow), and a competitive analysis engine (external data integration). Together they support sales, portfolio management, and strategic positioning.

## Capabilities

### Component A — Market analysis engine

- Centralized performance tracking of hundreds of internal and external factors.
- Flexible time-horizon analysis.
- Serves as structured data backbone for other components.

### Component B — AI commentary generator

- Agentic LLM workflow.
- Generates pre-authored market analysis over any time frame.
- Produces portfolio commentary explaining performance drivers.
- Integrates structured data rather than free-form prompting.

### Component C — Competitive analysis engine

- Integrates external databases (e.g., eVestment, fund holdings).
- Scenario-based comparison across internal and competitor strategies.
- Used to position products more effectively in prospect meetings.
- Bridges research, sales, and strategic positioning.

## Strategic value

- Applied AI within domain constraints.
- Structured integration of LLMs into investment workflows.
- Operational scaling of domain expertise.
- Cross-pillar organizational leverage.

## Organizational impact

Impact is framed as systems-enabled operational leverage: increased throughput without degradation of quality, cross-functional scaling of domain expertise, and institutional capability expansion rather than individual attribution.

### Asset growth context

During the period in which the AI-enabled systems were developed and deployed, the firm gathered over $9 billion in net new assets, representing the strongest asset gathering period in firm history. Asset growth is organizational and not solely attributable to these systems; the systems were deployed during and contributed to enhanced positioning, communication clarity, and operational leverage.

### Meeting effectiveness

New internal metrics were developed to track meeting progression and second-meeting conversion. Based on historical data comparisons, current meeting progression rates are approximately double prior historical norms, with increased meeting coverage relative to traditional annual levels. Exact industry conversion metrics are not publicly disclosed; position as directional improvement rather than precise percentages.

### Research and content production

Authored or significantly contributed to 15+ client-facing research memos since November, representing a dramatic increase in outward-facing research output relative to prior historical cadence. AI-enabled systems structured, pre-authored, and accelerated research production while maintaining editorial oversight.

## Adoption

- Cross-functional adoption across Sales, Portfolio Management, Research, and IT Infrastructure.
- Rapid expansion from demo usage to broader operational relevance.
- Transition from experimental tools to firm-supported infrastructure.
